### 🔍 Project Overview
The model was designed to generate descriptive captions for images, combining the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence prediction. We employed the Flickr8K dataset, a rich source of images and captions, to train our model, allowing it to learn from diverse scenarios and objects.
